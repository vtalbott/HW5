### Read in data

```{r}

homicides <- read_csv("../data/homicide-data.csv")
```


### Tidy data
This data was already Tidy when I used it in HW4 so I will use the same code
```{r}
## clean data
# make a new column called city_name that combines city and state for something like this "Baltimore, MD)
homicides <- homicides %>% 
  mutate(city_name = paste(city, state, sep = ", ")) 
#select columns
homicides <- homicides %>% 
  select(reported_date, city, state, disposition, city_name) %>% 
#lubridate
homicides <- homicides %>% 
  
  
#group by month and then sum up how many homicides their were

#filter down to Baltimore
  
#graph
```
