#### Load Libraries

```

### Read in data

```{r}
#read in data
homicides <- read_csv("../data/homicide-data.csv")
```


### Tidy data
This data was already Tidy when I used it in HW4 so I will use the same code
```{r}
## clean data
# make a new column called city_name that combines city and state for something like this "Baltimore, MD)
homicides <- homicides %>% 
  mutate(city_name = paste(city, state, sep = ", ")) 
#select columns
homicides <- homicides %>% 
  select(reported_date, city, state, disposition, city_name)
#lubridate
homicides <- homicides %>% 
  mutate(date_reported = ymd(reported_date)) %>% 
  select(-reported_date)

#group by month and year then sum up how many homicides their were
homicide_count <- homicides %>% 
  mutate(year = year(date_reported),        
         month = month(date_reported, label = TRUE)) %>%  
  group_by(year, month, city_name) %>%
  summarise(n = n())  
#filter down to Baltimore

#graph
```
