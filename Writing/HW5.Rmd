### Read in data

```{r}
#read in data
homicides <- read_csv("../data/homicide-data.csv")
```


### Tidy data
This data was already Tidy when I used it in HW4 so I will use the same code
```{r}
## clean data
# make a new column called city_name that combines city and state for something like this "Baltimore, MD)
homicides <- homicides %>% 
  mutate(city_name = paste(city, state, sep = ", ")) 

# unsolved data frame with one row per city that gives the total number of homicides for the city and the number of unsolved homicides. 
unsolved <- homicides %>% 
  group_by(city_name) %>% 
  summarise(
    total_homicides = n(),
    unsolved_homicides = sum(disposition %in% c("Closed without arrest", 
                                                "Open/No arrest")))
# filter down to data only for Baltimore
baltimore_unsolved <- unsolved %>% #filter down to Baltimore data
  filter(city_name == "Baltimore, MD")
```
