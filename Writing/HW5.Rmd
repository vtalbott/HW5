```


### Tidy data
Preparing data for the final graph that shows homicides per month over the years. 
```{r}
## clean data
# make a new column called city_name that combines city and state for something like this "Baltimore, MD)
homicides <- homicides %>% 
  mutate(city_name = paste(city, state, sep = ", ")) 
#select columns
homicides <- homicides %>% 
  select(reported_date, city, state, disposition, city_name)
#lubridate
homicides <- homicides %>% 
  mutate(date_reported = ymd(reported_date)) %>% 
  select(-reported_date)

#group by month and year then sum up how many homicides their were
homicide_count <- homicides %>% 
  mutate(year = year(date_reported),        
         month = month(date_reported, label = TRUE)) %>%  
  group_by(year, month, city_name) %>% #grouping data for further analysis
  summarise(n = n())  
#filter down to Baltimore
homicide_count <- homicide_count %>% 
  filter(city_name == "Baltimore, MD")
