## This is Victoria Talbott's homework 5.

The data used for this homework is a data set collected by the Washington Post on homicides in 50 large U.S. cities. The data had been previously analyzed in homework 4, and then a secondary figure was made in this homework (hw 5). The figure created in this homework shows monthly homicides in Baltimore. There is a reference added for the date of Freddie Gray's arrest. Color is used to show cold months (grey) vs warm months (blue). There is a smooth line to show seasonal and long term trends.
